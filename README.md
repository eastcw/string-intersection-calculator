# A script for calculating the intersection of strings

This script takes a number of text inputs, cleans them to accept only the 26 letters in the English alphabet, and then outputs the letters that are common to all inputs.

The easiest way to run it will be to copy the script into an online python interpreter [such as this one.](https://www.online-python.com/) Alternatively you can download the script and install python and then run it locally on your computer via the command line.

The no duplicates script is similar, but it ignores any letters that are in the overlap more than once, and only gives them once.
